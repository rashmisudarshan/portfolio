    {id: 14, title: "The sailor who fell from grace with the sea", author: "Yukio Mishima", readStatus: "Read", review: "The sailor who fell from grace with the sea is a book that tells the story of Ryuji Tsukazaki, a sailor of a cargo ship, who has spent his entire life at sea. He has no family and he is usually quiet and reserved, so he doesn’t befriend any of the other sailors either. He spends his days watching the sea and contemplating life. He is convinced that he is no ordinary human and that he is destined for glory. He is also convinced that he will find this glory at sea. So he spends his time searching and yearning. On the other end of the spectrum is Noboru Kuroda, a thirteen year old boy living on the shores of Japan with his widowed mother Fusako Kuroda. Noboru is convinced of his own genius. He is a member of a cult-like group of thirteen year old boys who perform various rituals to desensitize themselves(like killing a kitten to desensitize oneself from death or watching pornography to curb feelings of desire). Noboru finds a peephole in the wall between his and his mother’s room which he uses to spy on her while she walks around naked during the summer months. One such summer, Noboru and his mother Fusako go to the seashore to take a tour of a ship. Here they meet Ryuji. Fusako feels a connection with Ryuji and invites him to dinner at her house. After dinner she invites him up to her room and they have sex which Noboru spies on from his peephole. Noboru sees something in Ryuji that convinces him that he is a hero destined for glory. However the realities of life catch up with them, and Ryuji sets sail once again after three days. Fusako and Ryuji keep in touch and write letters to each other. When Ryuji comes back to Japan that winter, he asks Fusako to marry him. They get engaged and Fusako tries her best to make Noboru comfortable with the idea of a new father. One night Fusako sees light coming into her room through the peephole and realizes what Noboru has been doing. She is furious and asks Ryuji to punish Noboru for being a pervert. Ryuji however doesn’t punish Noboru in an attempt to be a friendly father. This however offends Noboru even more. He reports this incident to the chief of his group who decides that the only way the sailor can be restored to his former glory is by killing him. These murderous teenagers then lure Ryuji to a lonely spot on the pretext of wanting to hear his sailor stories. They then give him tea that is laced with sleeping tablets. The last thing that Ryuji thinks about before downing that fateful glass of tea is how much he misses the sea and the glory it brings with it. Still immersed in his dream, he drank down the tedip tea. It tasted bitter. Glory, as anyone knows, is bitter stuff. This is the story of how Ryuji Tsukazaki fell from grace with the sea. It may seem absurd or even repulsive if taken at face value. However when you take into context, Yukio Mishima’s life and world view, the metaphor becomes apparent. Mishima was a nationalist and did not like Imperial Japan’s transition to western culture after the war. The characters in this story serve that metaphor. Ryuji represents old Japan which was destined for glory. Fusako represents western influence. Ryuji falls from grace by “marrying” Fusako. Noboru and his gang represent Mishima who wants to restore Japan(i.e Ryuji) to its former glory. Whether or not one agrees with Mishima’s views is beside the point. The metaphor is beautiful regardless of one's personal political views on the matter. On the basis of the descriptions of the beautiful seashore alone, I could recommend this book. If this beautifully written, elaborate metaphor does not convince you of the genius of Mishima, there is still plenty in the book that will. ", image: sailor},

        title: "Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas",
        author: "Machado de Assis",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `Posthumous memoirs is not a novel that can’t be put into any particular genre. It is as vague in its form as it is in its message. But do not have the impression that this makes it a bad book. It is one of the best books I have read. Its form, the topics it discusses, its philosophies all have a modern flair to it that you would not expect in 1881, the year it was published. For the novel to maintain its appeal even after being translated from Portuguese to English is a feat on its own. To say it was way ahead of its time is an understatement.

        This is a memoir about the life of a Brazilian man named Brás Cubas. He writes this memoir from beyond the grave and this is the first point of unconventional form. The dedication of the book reads,
        "To the worm who gnawed the cold flesh of my corpse, I dedicate these posthumous memoirs as a nostalgic remembrance."
        This gives him some narrative freedom and a fresh unbiased perspective, he claims.

        There isn't much of a gripping plot to this book. Brás Cubas is an incredibly mediocre man who lived a privileged and uneventful life. This represents the lives of most people on earth. Most people are not destined for greatness and mediocrity is definitely not easy to come to terms with. Brás Cubas brazenly insults the reader with this charge which might be offensive to some, but it was hilarious to me.

        Brás starts off the book by narrating the story of his death and then starts to narrate his childhood. He claims to want to change the same old boring structure in which memoirs are usually written. In speculating the structure of the book, Brás directly addresses the reader, thus breaking two conventions in one shot, which is undoubtedly a mark of genius.

        The life of Brás is pretty uneventful. He is a young and frivolous man born to a privileged household and has an affair with a married woman who ends up leaving him and staying with her husband. Brás fails at his political career as well and basically squanders his whole life living off his inheritance money. His only achievement (according to Mr. Cubas himself) is that he did not transfer the misery of human experience to the next generation. The irony is, what does a man who never worked a day in his life know about the misery of life?

        The form of the book and plot does not however make a compelling argument to read the book. The thing that does that is its presentation of nihilistic philosophy in a very humorous way. It takes a depressing school of thought and makes it more palatable to a wide audience. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary to read, this is your book.`,

        title: "The Homecoming",
        author: "Sri M",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `Reading this book is like eating a box of variety chocolates. It consists of thirteen stories, each very different from the other. Like a variety pack, it contains a few horror stories, a few love stories, some myths, and some tragedies. 

My favourite story in this bunch is “Death of a Builder”. This is a charming yet tragic story of a silkworm that is determined to complete its journey to become a moth, only for its life to be cut short by selfish humans looking to make a buck. The story points out the tragedy and hypocrisy of human beings who snuff out the life of another innocent creature and then offer this in a temple in order to please God. 

For this and many other stories, I would recommend this book as a light and easy afternoon read.`,

        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `Metamorphosis is the story of a traveling salesman named Gregor Samsa who finds himself transformed into a “horrible vermin”. The story follows the changes in lifestyle and relationships that result from this transformation. 

The interpretation of the book is up for debate and a lot of the intended literary effects are lost in translation. Nevertheless, it’s a very interesting and thought-provoking novella. One of the interpretations is that the story is autobiographical and reveals Kafka’s own personal relationships with his father and sister. It depicts how he felt his existence to be a burden on his family, his strained relationship with his father, and his suicidal thoughts. 

At the end of the day, it is a depressing book, but it does provide food for thought, so I would definitely recommend it.`,

        title: "Hard Rain Falling",
        author: "Don Carpenter",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `Hard Rain Falling by Don Carpenter is a prison novel, yet it is so much more than that. It most certainly isn't a crime novel but follows the lives of criminals, delinquents, and those people who have been dealt a bad hand by life.

The main character, Jack Levitt, is a runaway from an orphanage. The book begins with the story of his birth and the tragic death of both his parents. Jack feels like he has been thrown into the world with nobody to love him and nowhere to go. The frustration of this feeling makes him run away from the orphanage in search of… something.

After running away, Jack spends his time in pool halls and gets by, by gambling and robbing people. Here he meets Billy Lancing, a young African American boy who is a prodigy. Jack is envious of Billy not only because he could make a living off his skills with the cue, but also because Billy had something he could pour his heart and soul into… a purpose.

That night they break into a house and have a party where Jack had planned to rob Billy of his money. Something stops him from doing that. In the morning, Jack is found passed out on the bed and arrested. He is then put in “reform” school. It will be a long time before the paths of these characters cross again.

The harsh conditions in which he lives are appalling. Jack is put in solitary confinement for almost three months for bad behaviour. Prisoners are treated as if they are less than human and nobody really cares if they die. In fact, they would be relieved that they would not have to maintain that file anymore.
“Jack Levitt was no longer an administrative problem.”

After Jack gets out of reform, he finds himself in jail once more for a crime that he did not commit. He realizes that he was part of a system designed to keep people like him locked up all the time. After Jack gets out of prison, he tries to apply for a federal job, but his application is rejected as they “don't hire ex-convicts.” He realizes that prison is not meant for reform, its purpose is punishment. Yet there was nobody he could be angry with. The system was not a single person or even a group of people. It was a set of rules. Even if everyone in the system were replaced with new people, the set of intangible rules would persist.

You may be of the opinion that this is a book about prison reform but then it has so many more themes discussing important aspects of life which I will leave for you to discover. It deals with homosexuality and masculinity in a way much ahead of its time. It deals with suicidal thoughts that arise from hitting rock bottom,
“I am going to die. Why not now? He felt cold and sick. Well, why not? What the fuck have I got to live for?”
If Jack Levitt could come out of that frame of mind alive, everyone can. It is a beautifully depressing book, way ahead of its time. Everyone should read it at least once.`,

        title: "Right Ho, Jeeves",
        author: "P.G. Wodehouse",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `Right Ho, Jeeves is a classic Jeeves and Wooster novel. Light, humorous, and filled with several crises (caused by Wooster) occurring simultaneously, all miraculously solved by Jeeves’ ingenious ideas, is the hallmark of a Jeeves and Wooster story.

The novel begins with the introduction of Gussie Fink Nottle, a school friend of Wooster. Gussie, having heard of Jeeves’ knack for solving seemingly impossible cases, seeks assistance for his own dilemma. He has fallen in love with a girl, Madeline Bassett (a friend of Bertie), but lacks the courage to propose. Bertie, feeling overshadowed by Jeeves’ reputation, is envious that everyone turns to Jeeves for advice when he believes he is equally (if not more) intelligent.

Bertie is called to Brinkley Court, his Aunt Dahlia’s residence, as his cousin Angela’s engagement to his friend Tuppy Glossop has fallen apart. Upon arriving at Brinkley, Bertie discovers that Jeeves’ services are once again required, and not his own. Determined to handle matters himself, Bertie also faces catastrophe number three: his Aunt has lost all the money her husband gave her while playing baccarat. Bertie’s advice to all three troubled individuals is to push away all the food offered at dinner to demonstrate their distress to their significant others.

This plan, though seemingly logical, backfires and exacerbates the situation. Anatole, the chef, is offended by the rejection of his carefully prepared dishes and resigns. This creates catastrophe number four. As usual in a Jeeves and Wooster tale, Jeeves arrives to save the day. He proposes that Bertie ring the fire alarm at midnight. The shock of imminent danger would make everyone realize their true feelings and resolve all the issues.

Bertie, however, ends up locking everyone outside the house in the middle of the night and is sent on a nine-mile bicycle ride to fetch the key from the butler, who has gone to a party. During Bertie’s absence, all conflicts are miraculously resolved. How Jeeves manages to achieve this is a cliffhanger I’ll leave you to ponder.`,

        title: "The Little Nugget",
        author: "P.G. Wodehouse",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: `The Little Nugget, with its multiple plot lines, humor, and “against all odds” happy ending for all characters, is exactly what you would expect from a P.G. Wodehouse novel. Although this book might be considered a little light on the humorous element, it still delivers an enjoyable read.

The story revolves around the titular character, Ogden Ford, a repulsive, overweight, and spoiled child. Ogden is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ford, wealthy Americans who are divorced. As the son of a rich man, Ogden is frequently targeted by kidnappers, earning him the nickname “The Little Nugget.” Mr. Ford, having won custody of Ogden in the divorce, denies Mrs. Ford access to her beloved son. In response, Mrs. Ford joins the group of kidnappers trying to abduct Ogden.

The novel begins with Mrs. Ford hiring Cynthia Drassilis to kidnap Ogden. Cynthia introduces us to Mr. Peter Burns, her fiancé, who has not yet recovered from his previous romantic failure with his ex-fiancé Audrey. Despite his own issues, Mr. Burns agrees to Cynthia’s request to kidnap Ogden by pretending to be a school teacher at Ogden’s private school.

Mr. Burns takes up a position at Sanstead Mansion, Ogden’s school, and soon discovers that he is not the only one with ulterior motives. A battle of wits ensues between him, Smooth Sam Fisher, and Buck Macginnis to claim “the nugget.” The plot further thickens with the unexpected presence of Audrey at the school, sent by Mr. Ford to ensure Ogden’s safety and prevent his kidnapping.

The way all these plots converge and end favorably for the characters (with the possible exception of Buck Macginnis) is truly remarkable. The “professional rivalry” between Burns and Sam alone is worth the read. Who ultimately wins “the nugget”? Does Mr. Burns find love at last? Discover the answers to these questions and more in “The Little Nugget.”`,

        title: "The Adventures of Pinocchio",
        author: "Carlo Collodi",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: "The Adventures of Pinocchio is a children’s novel, a classic that everybody knows about (the infamous nose lengthening scene) but not everyone has read. It was originally published in 1883 as a series in a children’s magazine by Italian author and journalist Carlo Collodi. Although the themes and the 'folk' style of storytelling, consisting of an abundance of talking animals and supernatural beings, suggest that it is a book meant only for children, some aspects of the book are decidedly quite adult. It contains plenty of lessons that are still applicable to a more mature audience (a little reading between the lines does help). It also contains plenty of scenes that can send shudders down the spines of kids and adults alike. So let us begin and follow Pinocchio along on his series of misadventures and journey to become a real boy.\n\nThe book starts off in the cabin of a carpenter, Master Cherry (named so because the color of the tip of his nose resembles a cherry). Master Cherry gives away his talking piece of wood to Master Geppetto, a wood carver. Geppetto carves a marionette out of this piece of wood and names him Pinocchio (literally translates to 'pine nut'). The first order of business for Pinocchio after having come to life is to steal his father’s wig, run away from home, and get his father arrested. If you thought Hadley Chase was fast-paced, you haven’t read Pinocchio yet.\n\nWhen Pinocchio returns home, lo and behold there’s a talking cricket giving him the first piece of advice that he doesn’t listen to. He says, 'Woe to boys who don't listen to their parents and run away from home.' As you may imagine, little boys don’t like to be told what to do, so Pinocchio silences the talking cricket by throwing a mallet at him and killing him. Compared to Jiminy Cricket, this cricket’s fate took quite the dark turn.\n\nSoon Pinocchio finds himself alone and hungry. He realizes that killing someone who knows more than you and tries to offer advice may not be the best strategy (Who knew?). Geppetto returns and feeds his little marionette the three pears he had saved for his own breakfast. He also sells his only coat to buy him a school book. This exemplifies a father’s love, aggressive yet giving. Even though Geppetto is short-tempered, got arrested because of Pinocchio, he doesn’t think twice before making these sacrifices for him.\n\nPinocchio then starts off on his journey to school. Here he is presented with his first temptation to stray off the right path and he takes it, only to suffer the consequences. He sells his school book to watch a marionette theater, ruins the show, and faces the wrath of the show director, Fire Eater, who threatens to use him as firewood. Fortunately for Pinocchio, Fire Eater has much more of a conscience than his movie counterpart Stromboli. He spares Pinocchio’s life and gives him five pieces of gold to take back to his father.\n\nThe next part of the story is Pinocchio’s encounter with the 'lame' fox and the 'blind' cat who not only swindle him of his gold but also try to hang him from a noose so he chokes to death. This part of the story did seem needlessly violent for a children’s book to me at first, but when I gave it some thought, I realized there really is no point trying to convince kids that we live in a fairy world only to shake them into reality when they turn eighteen. This encounter with the fox and the cat also conveys a very important message to not listen to bad advice (as told by the blackbird). The soul of the talking cricket reiterates this: 'Don’t listen to those who promise you wealth overnight, my boy. As a rule, they are either fools or swindlers.' A solid piece of advice for adults too, wouldn't you agree?\n\nNow we come to the most iconic part of the story. A blue fairy with azure hair (a kind of motherly figure) saves Pinocchio by bringing him down from the tree in which he was hanging. When she asks him about the gold pieces, he lies to her saying he lost them. This causes his nose to lengthen by a few inches for every lie. Although it may seem juvenile to teach an adult the moral lesson of 'Don’t lie,' I feel it is something that we tend to forget along the way and a small reminder from the blue fairy wouldn’t hurt: 'A lie grows and grows until it's as apparent as the nose on your face.'\n\nThere is no dearth of misadventures that the little marionette experiences, but there is one more that I would like to highlight both for the relevance of the moral lesson it teaches and to underline the dark themes that run as an undercurrent throughout the book. On the eve of when Pinocchio is about to become a real boy, he is convinced by his schoolmate 'Lamp-wick' to run away to the Land of Toys. As wonderful as that sounds, this isn’t really a wonderland. It is a place with no obligations and responsibilities where little boys can wreak havoc all day long with no consequences. So Pinocchio is led astray one last time by bad company and ends up turning into a donkey, being sold to the circus, whipped until he’s lame, and sold once more to be skinned and used as a drum skin. That's what happens to naughty kids who don’t study for four months.\n\nTurning lazy little boys into donkeys and selling them for a profit is quite the business model (disregarding any concerns about morality, of course). This, however, happens to be the last leg of Pinocchio’s long run of bad luck. After this, he manages to escape, turns back into a marionette with the help of the blue fairy, saves his father who had been living inside the belly of a giant shark that had swallowed him (dubbed 'Monstro' the whale in the movie), and finally turns into a real boy. Who would have thought we would get a 'happily ever after' kind of ending after all that?\n\nPinocchio is a mischievous boy but his internal monologue suggests that he is self-aware. This, along with the love he has for his father and fairy mother, leads me to believe that deep down he did have a good heart. Although this may be the case, there is more of an innocence to his character in the Disney movie. Walt Disney thought that his character in the book might be too unlikable to portray on screen (a pretty good decision, in my opinion). In the book, however, this gullible, easily manipulated character serves as a symbol of transformation. Pinocchio transforms from a marionette that is controlled with strings by others to a real boy with independent thoughts. He does this by proving he is brave, truthful, unselfish, and mature enough to handle himself in the real world, which is a dark and cruel place.",

        title: "Born to Run",
        author: "Bruce Springsteen",
        readStatus: "Read",
        review: "Born to Run is the autobiography of the rock and roll legend and my personal favorite artist of all time Bruce Springsteen. Reading an autobiography reveals a lot of personal details and intricate facts about a person’s life. This, in my case, made me fall more in love with 'The Boss'.\n\nThe first part of the book titled 'Growin’ up' narrates everything leading up to his fame. It may seem to people that he became an overnight sensation with the release of Born to Run but reading this book sheds light on the years of struggle that it took to actually become an overnight sensation. We get a sense of his roots and influences, how the town he lived in (Freehold, New Jersey) influenced his work and life for years. A lot of lyrics start making a bit more sense. For instance, Springsteen grew up in his grandma’s house where he was treated like a king, and he felt happy and content. After her death, her house was converted into a parking lot and he moved back to his parent’s house. The transition wasn't easy for little Bruce. This revelation gives new meaning to the lines, '... and all of our victories and glories, are turned into parking lots.' ~Wrecking ball.\n\nThere are a lot of little details about Bruce’s family tree. His mother and the Italian side of his family loved to party, dance and have a good time. This is where his love for music took root. His father’s and the Irish side of the family is where he inherited some of his own mental illness from. His father himself suffered from serious mental illness which he didn’t understand much as a child and led to a tough relationship from the very beginning. Bruce writes about his father, 'He loved me but couldn’t stand me.'\n\nThe second part of the book talks about Bruce’s albums from Born to Run right up to Tunnel of Love. He explains the inspiration and intent behind each of his works. To hear the significance of the art from the mouth of the artist himself is reason enough to read this book. He talks about his transition to writing about political issues leading up to the release of 'Born in the USA'. The stories of Walter and Ray Cichon who were close friends and mentors of Bruce in the early years can be heard in the tracks of 'Born in the USA'. Walter was drafted in the army and came to a tragic death fighting the front lines in South Vietnam. Bruce writes about them, 'They were heroes and their deaths anger me to this day.'\n\nHe discusses his relationship with each member of his band The E Street Band, especially Clarence Clemons. Clarence 'The Big Man' Clemons was the saxophonist in the E Street Band who shared a special relationship with Bruce even though they were different in almost every aspect. He writes that the photos taken for the Born to Run cover looked like as if they shared a secret. Bruce beautifully depicts and acknowledges the race tensions that existed within his band and the sexism when Patti joined as well.\n\nHe talks about how he had a tough time coming to terms with his fame and the anxiety of always being watched by the paparazzi. He didn't like this aspect of being famous. He describes his concert in London where he had an internal mental breakdown seeing so many posters proclaiming him to be the next big thing. He writes, 'My business is SHOW business and that is the business of SHOWING… not TELLING. You don’t TELL people anything, you SHOW them, and let them decide. That’s how I got here, by SHOWING people.'\n\nThe third part of the book describes his marriage to Patti and his transition from the 'On the Road' type life to starting a family of his own. His description of the birth of his first child is heartwarming and endearing, 'All protective veils slip, all defenses are down, defeated, all emotional “conditions” are suspended, all negotiations are ceased'. Here in his family Bruce finally finds what he is yearning for.\n\nThis book is a must-read, not only for all fans of Bruce Springsteen but also all rock and roll fans looking to discover new songs. Listening to the songs he grew up listening to and was inspired by takes you back to that time and place. This book also shows Bruce and his struggle with mental illness and depression (or the “night terrors” as he called them). Seeing him being so open about it and reading about his fight and how he overcame it is an inspiration to anyone going through a rough patch.\n\nFor me personally, what’s most inspiring is Bruce’s hardworking nature and “never give up, come what may” attitude. Jon Stewart described in his tribute to Bruce that he is a man who “empties the tank” for everything in his life. To read this book is to see that nature exemplified. All in all, 'Born to Run' is a beautifully written and touching memoir that I would recommend in a heartbeat.",

        review: "The Daughter from a Wishing Tree is a collection of short stories about women in Indian mythology. Besides narrating interesting and unusual tales from Indian mythology, it gives the reader a sense of how important and powerful the goddesses were in India. It shows that if you are a woman, even being a goddess doesn’t shield you from misogyny. Given these circumstances and the patriarchal world we live in, this book serves as a source of reassurance that with a bit of courage and the grace of the goddesses, we ordinary women too, can overcome.\n\nMany of the stories in the book follow a similar plot line. There is a powerful asura who is granted a boon (By Brahma, Shiva, or some Devi) for his penance. All that these asuras usually desire is immortality which of course cannot be granted. He then tries to find a loophole in the laws of the universe (for example 'No male member of any species can kill me') after which he begins to commit atrocities in all three lokas. The gods being powerless at this point, turn to the all-powerful goddesses for help. The goddess then slays the asura in question and restores peace and harmony to the universe.\n\nAnother common storyline is that of faith. Having faith in the Devi always ensures her protection. The goddess is always there to help her devotees in their time of need. So those who keep her in their heart be rest assured that she will come to their aid.\n\nThis book also helped me notice and appreciate a lot of things I see around me in India. Living in the vicinity of a large and famous Banashankari temple in Bangalore, I always wondered why it drew such huge crowds of people. Only after reading this book did I learn that Banashankari is the goddess representing fruits and vegetables. This is why she is such an important part of people’s lives in India.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a light and easy book to read to learn about some of the mythology and folklore of Indian culture with a dash of feminism to satisfy a modern reader and inspire a generation of little girls.",

        review: "Pedro Páramo is one of those books that takes some time to fully sink in, but then the extra effort required to understand it is rewarded. It is a masterfully subtle and intriguing ghost story set in a town called Comala (Mexico). The story’s narrator Juan sets off on a journey to Comala to meet his father at the request of his dying mother. Soon after he reaches Comala he realizes that it is a ghost town and all its residents have long been dead. As he explores the town and talks to more of the ghosts, he slowly starts to piece together the history of the town and how it became a dead and desolate place. He also learns about his father and how he was responsible for the current state of the town.\n\nThe narrative flows from one story to another without any indications about whose story it is or when that event took place. This makes it a little hard to grasp the sequence of events and requires close attention while reading.
